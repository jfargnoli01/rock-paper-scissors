## How to Use Application

  - The Difficult Version includes 5 fighters that the user can choose from: rock, paper, scissors, ufo, and iguana
  - The user selects a fighter to face off with the computer's fighter, this will be identified with the user token below the fighter
  - Once both fighters are selected, the game will reveal the outcome of the round
  - The player that chooses the winning opponent wins the round and is awarded a point
